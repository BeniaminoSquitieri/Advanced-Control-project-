# Mechanical Stabilization System Control Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the evaluation and enhancement of a mechanical stabilization system designed to maintain a shelf in an upright vertical position. The goal is to assess the performance of an existing control algorithm and propose improvements. The tasks involve developing alternative controllers, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each, and presenting the results. The project is divided into multiple work packages (WP) with specific objectives.

### Context

The control system governs a rigid shelf, and the main challenge is stabilizing it in a vertical position. The system dynamics are defined by a given mathematical model, and the existing controller (v0) has known limitations when applied to the nonlinear system. The project focuses on improving this controller and exploring alternative control strategies.

## Problem Description

The system can be described by the following variables:
- **m = 1kg**: Mass of the shelf.
- **l = 1m**: Length of the support rod.
- **g = 9.81m/s²**: Gravitational acceleration.
- **b = 0.1**: Friction coefficient.

The mathematical model for the system is:
ẋ1 = x2 ẋ2 = -(g/l)sin(x1) - (b/ml²)x2 + (u(t)/ml²) y = x1
Where:
- **x1 (θ)** is the angle formed by the rod and the vertical axis.
- **x2 (θ̇)** is the angular velocity.
- **u(t)** is the control input (torque generated by the motor).
- **x = [x1, x2]T** represents the state of the system.

The controller's objective is to ensure the output, **y**, follows a reference **r(t)**, typically set as **π** radians (vertical position).

## Work Packages (WP)

The project is organized into multiple tasks (Work Packages), each addressing specific aspects of the controller design and system evaluation:

### WP1: Evaluation of Existing Controller (v0)

The initial task is to evaluate the performance of the existing linear controller **v0**, which is defined as:
u(t) = -Kx(t) + kr r(t) K = [18235, 53.9] kr = 18235 r(t) = π
- This controller was designed for the linearized system around the equilibrium point **xe = [π, 0]T**.
- The task involves assessing the controller's limitations on the nonlinear system and analyzing the results using relevant metrics (e.g., rise time, settling time, overshoot).

### WP2: Design of a New Linear Controller (v1)

The goal of WP2 is to design a new linear controller **v1** to improve the system's closed-loop performance, focusing on:
- Reducing rise time and settling time.
- Minimizing overshoot.

### WP3: State Observer Design

To reduce sensor costs, WP3 involves designing a state observer assuming only **x1** (the angular position) can be measured. The observer is incorporated into the control loop, and the performance of the closed-loop system with the observer is evaluated using **v1**.

### WP4: Feedback Linearization Controller (v2)

WP4 requires designing a new controller **v2** based on **feedback linearization**. The objective is to evaluate this controller and compare its performance to **v1**. Additionally, the task explores how the controller can be modified to track time-varying references (although simulations for this are not mandatory).

### WP5: Gain Scheduling Controller (v3)

In WP5, a new controller **v3** is designed using **gain scheduling**. This controller is evaluated and compared to **v2**, with simulations provided for time-varying reference inputs (chosen by the group).

### WP6: Presentation and Final Recommendation

The results from all the WPs are presented using a provided presentation template. The group is required to conclude by recommending which controller is the best to use and justify the decision based on performance metrics and trade-offs.
